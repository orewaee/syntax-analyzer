## What's that?

A syntax analyzer written in Rust as part of one of my university course subjects.

The current version knows how to determine whether a chain of the `xyz` kind with an arbitrary number (greater than 0) of `x`, `y` and `z` belongs to it.
That is, the chain xyz is the minimal possible chain.
